        <h1>Building with a Ramdisk</h1>
<p>TL;DR: Ramdisks don't help build times.</p>
<p>I've long been thinking that C++ build times were often disk IO limited. The
biggest thing that lead me to think that was the speedup in build times when I 
moved from spinning disks to SSDs. I don't have any numbers for it, but 
anecdotally it was a big speedup. </p>
<p>I recently got some time on Microsoft Azure's F72 VM, with 72 compute cores and
144GB of RAM. Just to see it fly, I ran my <a href="https://github.com/teeks99/boost-release-windows">Boost Windows Build</a> on it, and was somewhat 
underwhelmed by the results. This got me thinking that maybe the build was
limited by the disk IO to the machine. Thinking about ways to solve this, I 
remembered from my time in the 90s that there are pieces of software called 
"Ramdisks" that let you have a virtual hard disk that is backed by system
memory, so won't be affected by the typical limits of spinning or SSD disks.</p>
<p>After looking around, I found an open source tool called 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/">ImDisk</a> that allows you to
create Ramdisks on windows (Linux comes with the <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/what-is-devshm-and-its-practical-usage.html">/run/shm ramdisk</a>
 enabled by default). </p>
<p>Once I had that, I decided to run some tests. Since I work with 
<a href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> a lot, I'm using a couple different tests from
there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Binary Build - Each release, I 
    <a href="https://github.com/teeks99/boost-release-windows">build and package</a> the 
    windows binaries for boost. This runs several version of Visual Studio 
    (msvc-10.0 through msvc-14.1) in several configurations: Debug/Release, 
    mt/mtdll, static/dynamic, 32/64. This also packages up the build with 
    <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc">Inno Setup</a>.</li>
<li>Boost Regression Test Suite - I 
    <a href="https://github.com/teeks99/boost-build">run this</a> regularly across several
    machines (and a lot of 
    <a href="https://github.com/teeks99/boost-cpp-docker">docker containers</a>), and have
    good data on how long it takes to run.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Machines</h2>
<ul>
<li>F72<ul>
<li>72 Core (Intel Xeon Platinum 8186 @ 2.70GHz)</li>
<li>144GB Ram</li>
<li>576GB Temp Storage</li>
<li>$5.86/hr (Windows) $3.045/hr (Linux)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>F16<ul>
<li>16 Core</li>
<li>32GB Ram</li>
<li>256GB Temp Storage</li>
<li>$1.53/hr (Windows) $.0796/hr (Linux)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local VM<ul>
<li>8 Core</li>
<li>16GB Ram</li>
<li>100GB Temp Storage</li>
<li>$600 amortized over the last 2.5yrs + electricity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the machines with more than 100GB of RAM, I created a ramdisk with 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/">ImDisk</a>. For the 
build/package tests, I ran my standard <a href="https://github.com/teeks99/boost-release-windows">build for windows releases</a> scripts for a build of 1.69.
I ran (including creation of packages) from the ramdisk and from the azure 
temp storage (a local SSD).  Because the smaller machines couldn't run the
whole thing in the ramdisk, I ran single builds on them where possible. For the
<a href="https://github.com/teeks99/boost-build">regression tests</a>, I was only able to 
run in a ramdisk on the F72 machine, but was able to run under both linux and
windows.</p>

<p>Initially when I ran, the Inno Setup task was taking much longer. However, I 
went on a tangent exploration, and found the 
<a href="https://github.com/teeks99/inno-test/">best settings for running parallelized</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It turns out that ramdisks don't do a thing to build times. Clearly modern
compilation isn't bound by storage I/O. On the other hand it was hard to get
the F72 machine to spike all the CPUs. This could indicate that there just isn't
enough parallelization in the build system. I know from watching that big swaths
of the regression test is taken up by single threaded tasks (git updates,
setup, etc.). I'd be curious to take a more modern build system like 
<a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja</a> for a spin on an F72.</p>
